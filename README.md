# MSSA Project: Pokémon Decision Making
The Microsoft Software and Systems Academy (MSSA) is a program designed to teach transitioning servicemembers and veterans the skills necessary for moving into the IT field. I am attending the MSSA program for Cloud Application Development (CAD) hosted by Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (ERAU) in San Diego, CA. All students are required to complete a personal project as part of the 19-week course. This repository hosts all of the files and documents necessary for the completion of my project.

## Project Motivation / Background
I have been playing Pokémon on-and-off since 5th grade. I came to the game late compared to my friends who were immediately swept up by the first generation of games in the late 1990s, but it has stuck with me longer.

While most people are familiar with the trading cards, the anime series, and the story mode of the Pokémon video games, the competitive scene for Pokémon has been relatively unknown until recently. The rules for competitive Pokémon battles are far more complex than the regular story mode,  which has the effect of turning a simple children's game into a difficult game of strategy and information management. One former world champion describes the  competitive version of Pokémon as a mixture of chess, poker, and rock-paper-scissors.

While the most recent generation of games (Sword and Shield, the 8th Generation) have made it far easier to build competitively viable Pokémon teams, that has not made competitive battles any easier. Each Pokémon has a wide range of moves, stats, abilities, and items that players must consider in order to be successful, and with more players than ever eager to learn the competitive scene it is becoming more difficult to find and exploit an advantage in the game. 

Therefore, the motivation behind this project is to build a web application that aids players as they analyze Pokémon individually, build teams, and prepare for battles against their opponents. This application will enable players to examine combinations and interactions that they might otherwise miss (or not have time to calculate for themselves). It will also help players keep track of the information they have revealed to their opponents and vice versa during in the course of a competitive match.

For more information on the background and motivation behind this project, see the paper and presentation in folder "01. Project Proposal and Presentation."

## Entity Relationship Diagrams
The picture below is my initial entity relationship diagram for the database I will build to support my application. I used Draw.io. The JPEG and PDF version of the ERD can also be found in folder "02. Database Entity Relationship Diagrams."

## Project Data
There are many sources for Pokémon data, and there is a lot of it. The folder "03. Project Data (Excel and CSV" will contain all of the raw data that I need to complete this project. Although the current competitive rules only allows for a subset of the 400 Pokémon available in Sword and Shield to participate in official battles, I want to include data on all Pokémon from all generations in order to make the application accommodating to future rules changes and new game releases. 

## Building the Database
I will use T-SQL and Microsoft SQL Server to build the primary database for this project. The folder "04. SQL Solution and Queries" contains all of the queries I have written to build the database (so far).

## Website Wire Frames
Below are a few of the wire frame designs I have made for the application's website. These are not all of the pages I have designed, nor are they final designs. I used [https://pencil.evolus.vn/](https://pencil.evolus.vn/) to create the wire frames. I also included a diagram that I sketched in OneNote.
